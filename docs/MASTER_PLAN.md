# ðŸš€ NeuronLang: Master Development Plan

## Mission Statement
**Build the world's first AI-native programming language from the ground up. No compromises. Fix root causes. Revolutionary, not evolutionary.**

## Core Principles
1. **NO COMPROMISES** - Fix root causes, not symptoms
2. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - Every decision, every test, every metric
3. **R&D FIRST** - Research deeply before implementing
4. **MEASURE ALWAYS** - Data-driven decisions only
5. **REVOLUTIONARY** - Don't copy, innovate

## No Compromise Zones

**NEVER**:
- Add a feature without understanding root cause
- Skip documentation for speed
- Accept "good enough" performance
- Copy design without improvement
- Ship with known correctness issues

**ALWAYS**:
- Measure before optimizing
- Document design decisions
- Test edge cases
- Benchmark against competition
- Get user feedback
