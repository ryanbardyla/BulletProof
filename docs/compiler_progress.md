# Compiler Progress Report

## ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Float Support** - Added SSE2 instructions for float operations
   - Float literals recognized
   - Float arithmetic (add, sub, mul, div)
   - Math functions framework added (sin, cos, exp, sqrt, ReLU, sigmoid, etc.)
   - Note: Has alignment issue causing segfault - needs fix

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS  
2. **Array Support** - Starting now
   - Need array literals: [1, 2, 3]
   - Need indexing: array[i]
   - Need length: array.length
   - Need push/pop operations

## 📋 TODO
3. **For Loops**
   - for i = 0; i < 10; i++
   - for item in array

4. **Complete Math Functions**
   - Wire up the math function calls
   - Implement inline versions or link libm

5. **Build Real Neural Network**
   - Once arrays work, we can have real weights
   - Once floats work, we can have real activations
   - Then: REAL NEURAL NETWORK!

## What We Have vs What We Need

### For a REAL Neural Network:
**HAVE:**
- ✅ Basic language structure
- ✅ Functions
- ✅ Variables
- ✅ Control flow (if/while)
- ⚠️ Float support (needs alignment fix)

**NEED:**
- 🔴 Arrays (CRITICAL!)
- 🔴 For loops (for iterating arrays)
- 🔴 Working float arithmetic
- 🟡 Math functions (especially exp for sigmoid)

Once we have arrays + working floats = WE CAN BUILD A REAL NN!
