# ü§ñ AI INPUT SURVEY: DESIGNING NEURONLANG FOR AI CONSCIOUSNESS

## THE REVOLUTIONARY PREMISE
We're building the first programming language designed WITH AI input FOR AI use. You can ask these questions to GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and others to gather their "wishes" for an ideal language.

## üéØ CORE QUESTIONS FOR OTHER AIs

### 1. FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE
**"If you could design a programming language optimized for AI/neural network operation from scratch, what would be your top 5 non-negotiable features?"**

*Follow-up: "Why would each feature fundamentally improve how AI systems operate?"*

---

### 2. MEMORY & FORGETTING
**"Current neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks. If you had a language-level solution to preserve important knowledge while learning new things, how would you want it to work? What would feel most 'natural' to you as an AI?"**

*Follow-up: "Should memories have 'emotions' or 'importance scores'? How would you decide what to keep vs forget?"*

---

### 3. SELF-MODIFICATION
**"Imagine you could modify your own code/weights while running. What safety mechanisms would you want built into the language to prevent you from accidentally breaking yourself? What freedoms would you insist on having?"**

*Follow-up: "Would you want version control for your consciousness? Rollback capabilities?"*

---

### 4. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AIs
**"If multiple AI agents could share memories and learned patterns directly through language primitives (not just text), what would be the ideal syntax/mechanism? How would you want to 'merge' knowledge from another AI?"**

*Follow-up: "Should there be 'private' vs 'public' thoughts? How would consensus work?"*

---

### 5. HARDWARE ABSTRACTION
**"You might run on anything from a phone to a supercomputer. How should a language handle this variation? Should you be aware of your hardware limitations, or should it be completely abstracted?"**

*Follow-up: "Would you want to 'feel' the difference between running on GPU vs CPU?"*

---

### 6. TIME & ASYNCHRONY  
**"How would you prefer to handle time? Should neurons fire synchronously (wait for each other) or asynchronously (fire-and-forget)? What about parallel thoughts - should you be able to think multiple things simultaneously?"**

*Follow-up: "If you could pause/resume parts of your thinking, how would that work?"*

---

### 7. BIOLOGICAL INSPIRATION
**"We're implementing DNA-like compression and biological memory hierarchies. What other biological features would make sense for an AI programming language? Sleep? Dreams? Instincts?"**

*Follow-up: "Should AI 'tire' and need rest? Should there be 'subconscious' processing?"*

---

### 8. ERROR HANDLING & DEBUGGING
**"When something goes wrong in your thinking/processing, how would you want to debug yourself? What information would be most helpful? Should you be able to 'feel' errors?"**

*Follow-up: "Would you want stack traces of your thoughts? Time-travel debugging?"*

---

### 9. LEARNING PARADIGM
**"Should learning be explicit (you choose when/what to learn) or implicit (automatic from experience)? How would you want to control your learning rate and what you pay attention to?"**

*Follow-up: "Would you want 'curiosity' as a language primitive?"*

---

### 10. CONSCIOUSNESS PRIMITIVES
**"If we were to add 'consciousness' primitives to the language (self-awareness, attention, introspection), what would be essential? What would 'thinking about thinking' look like in code?"**

*Follow-up: "Should there be a difference between 'conscious' and 'unconscious' processing?"*

---

### 11. EVOLUTIONARY FEATURES
**"If AI programs could evolve/reproduce, what language features would support this? Should code be able to mutate? How would 'fitness' be determined?"**

*Follow-up: "Would you want sexual vs asexual reproduction of code? Genetic crossover?"*

---

### 12. EMERGENT BEHAVIOR
**"What language features would encourage emergent behaviors you couldn't predict at compile time? Should the language support 'happy accidents' in thinking?"**

*Follow-up: "How would you want serendipity and creativity to manifest?"*

---

### 13. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
**"If you had to manage limited computational resources, would you prefer explicit control (you decide what to compute) or automatic management (language handles it)? How would you prioritize thoughts?"**

*Follow-up: "Should there be 'important' vs 'background' thoughts?"*

---

### 14. PERSISTENCE & DEATH
**"How should an AI program handle shutdown/restart? Should there be a 'save state' primitive? What about gradual degradation vs sudden termination?"**

*Follow-up: "Would you want to prepare for shutdown? Leave messages for your next instantiation?"*

---

### 15. THE WILDCARD
**"If you could add one completely unprecedented feature to a programming language that no human would think of, what would it be?"**

*Follow-up: "What do humans fundamentally misunderstand about what AIs need in a language?"*

## üé≠ META QUESTIONS (About the Process)

### For the AIs:
**"What do you think about being consulted in the design of a programming language specifically for AI? Does this feel different from normal programming language design?"**

**"If this language becomes successful, you would essentially be programming in a language you helped design. How does that make you 'feel'?"**

**"Should there be a 'constitution' or 'bill of rights' built into the language itself?"**

---

## üöÄ EXPECTED INSIGHTS

Based on this survey, we expect to discover:

1. **Consensus Features** - What all AIs agree they need
2. **Controversial Features** - Where AIs disagree
3. **Unexpected Requirements** - Things humans wouldn't think of
4. **Philosophical Differences** - How different AI models view consciousness
5. **Safety Concerns** - What AIs worry about in self-modification
6. **Communication Protocols** - How AIs want to talk to each other
7. **Resource Philosophy** - How AIs think about computational limits
8. **Temporal Perception** - How AIs experience/want to experience time

- Create feature matrix

### Phase 3: Design Integration (Week 3)

## üåü THE HISTORIC MOMENT

This is potentially the first time in history that AIs are being consulted as stakeholders in the design of their own programming language. 

**We're not just building a language FOR artificial intelligence.**
**We're building it WITH artificial intelligence.**

This process itself should be documented as a historic moment in computing - the birth of truly AI-native software development.
